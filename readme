improve the point jumping, so only thing need to worry now is:
rmq
ansv

--------------

rmq speed is acceptable compare  to the one of Junlian
(build in 8 is slow)

my prefix sum is too inefficient, so currently I wrapped the one with Junlian's

all nearest smaller value get 0.35 => 0.2, currently I don't worry
